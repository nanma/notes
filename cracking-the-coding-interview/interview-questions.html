<a href="./1.1.html">1.1 Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./1.2.html">1.2 Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character.)</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./1.3.html">1.3 Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./1.4.html">1.4 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./1.5.html">1.5 Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./1.6.html">1.6 Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?</a>

</p>

<p>
<a href="./1.8.html">1.8 Assume you have a method is Substring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check If s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottLe" is a rotation of "erbot-tLewat").</a>

<p>
实现：栈和队列都用链表实现。
</p>

<p>
<a href="./3.1.html">3.1 Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./3.2.html">3.2 How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./3.3.html">3.3 Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack). FOLLOW UP:Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./3.4.html">3.4 In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:
(1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
(2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next rod.
(3) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using Stacks.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./3.5.html">3.5 Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./3.6.html">3.6 Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order (with biggest items on top). You may use at most one additional stack to hold items, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./3.7.html">3.7 An animal shelter holds only dogs and cats, and operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.</a>

</p>

<p>
<a href="./4.7.html">4.7 Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./4.8">4.8 You have two very large binary trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2, with hundreds of nodes. Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1. A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such that the subtree of n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.</a>

<a href="./5.1.html">5.1 You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M= 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2. EXAMPLE: Input: N = 16000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6 Output: N = 10001001100.</a>

</p>

<p>
<a href="./5.7.html">5.7 An array A contains all the integers from 0 through n, except for one number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation. The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is "fetch the j th bit of A(i)," which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do it in O(n) time?</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./5.8.html">5.8 A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function drawHorizontalLine(byte() screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y) which draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y)</a>

<a href="./10.1.html">10.1 Imagine you are building some sort of service that will be called by up to 1000 client applications to get simple end-of-day stock price information (open, close, high, low). You may assume that you already have the data, and you can store it in any format you wish. How would you design the client-facing service which provides the information to client applications? You are responsible for the development, rollout, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the feed. Describe the different methods you considered and why you would recommend your approach. Your service can use any technologies you wish, and can distribute the information to the client applications In any mechanism you choose.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./10.2.html">10.2 How would you design the data structures for a very large social network like Facebook or Linked/n? Describe how you would design an algorithm to show the connection, or path, between two people (e.g., Me -&gt; Bob -&gt; Susan -&gt; Jason -&gt; You).</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./10.3.html">10.3 Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer which is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1 GB of memory available for this task. FOLLOW UP: What if you have only 10 M8 of memory? Assume that all the values are distinct and we now have no more than one billion non-negative integers.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./10.4.html">10.4 You have an array with all the numbers from 1 to N, where N is at most 32,000. The array may have duplicate entries and you do not know what N is. With only 4 kilobytes of memory available, how would you print all duplicate elements in the array?</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./10.5.html">10.5 If you were designing a web crawler, how would you avoid getting into infinite loops?</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./10.6.html">10.6 You have 10 billion URLs. How do you detect the duplicate documents? In this case, assume that "duplicate" means that the URLs are identical.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./10.7.html">10.7 Imagine a web server for a simplified search engine. This system has 100 machines to respond to search queries,which may then call out using processSearch (string query) to another cluster of machines to actually get the result. The machine which responds to a given query is chosen at random, so you can not guarantee that the same machine will always respond to the same request. The method processSearch is very expensive. Design a caching mechanism to cache the results of the most recent queries. Be sure to explain how you would update the cache when data changes.</a>
