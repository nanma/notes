* Data Structures

** Chapter 1 | Arrays and Strings
[[./1.1.html][1.1 Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?]]

[[./1.2.html][1.2 Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character.)]]

[[./1.3.html][1.3 Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.]]

[[./1.4.html][1.4 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)]]

[[./1.5.html][1.5 Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string]]

[[./1.6.html][1.6 Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?]]

[[./1.7.html][1.7 Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.]]

[[./1.8.html][1.8 Assume you have a method is Substring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check If s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottLe" is a rotation of "erbot-tLewat").]]
** Chapter 2 | Linked Lists
链表相关技巧：

1. 双指针移动
2. 递归方法

[[./2.1.html][2.1 Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. FOLLOW UP: How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?]]

[[./2.2.html][2.2 Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.]]

[[./2.3.html][2.3 Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.]]

[[./2.4.html][2.4 Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before alt nodes greater than or equal to x.]]

[[./2.5.html][2.5 You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1 's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.]]

[[./2.6.html][2.6 Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns the node at the beginning of the loop.]]

[[./2.7.html][2.7 Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.]]

** Chapter 3 | Stacks and Queues
实现：栈和队列都用链表实现。

[[./3.1.html][3.1 Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.]]
