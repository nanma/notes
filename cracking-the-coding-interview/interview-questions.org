* Data Structures

** Chapter 1 | Arrays and Strings
[[./1.1.html][1.1 Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?]]

[[./1.2.html][1.2 Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character.)]]

[[./1.3.html][1.3 Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.]]

[[./1.4.html][1.4 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)]]

[[./1.5.html][1.5 Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string]]

[[./1.6.html][1.6 Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?]]
